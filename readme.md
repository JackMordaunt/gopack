# gopack 

gopack is a (work in progress) tool that packages Gio programs into valid operating system packages. 

For macOS this is a `.app` directory structure, and for Windows it's a `.exe` executable binary with an embedded icon resource.

The end goal for this tool is to be a single-command cross-platform build tool for Gio programs. 

Contributions welcome!
